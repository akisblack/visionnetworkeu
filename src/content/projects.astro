<h3>Our House is on Fire</h3>
<p>“Our House is on Fire” was an Erasmus+ youth exchange project held in 2022 in the Carinthian mountain village of Grafenbach, Austria, bringing together young people aged 14–19 and group leaders from Austria, Greece, and Serbia. During the exchange, participants took part in workshops, discussions, outdoor activities, and intercultural cooperation focused on climate change, youth activism, and ways young people can make their voices heard. The project also promoted inclusion by involving young refugees, strengthened responsibility and teamwork through shared daily tasks, and helped participants improve their German language skills while building friendships and a stronger sense of European citizenship.</p>
