We are Vision Network informal group. We were created in 2019 as a small youth initiative connected to Vision Network Athens (VNA), where we were active members and volunteers from a young age. At that time, we were originally known as Young Visioners in Action. We wanted a space where we could take initiative, learn by doing, and explore youth participation in a flexible and informal way.
<br /><br />
Over the years, we have grown through our involvement in VNA’s local activities, workshops, and Erasmus+ projects, mainly as participants and young volunteers. Through this process, we developed experience in non-formal education, teamwork, and international cooperation. Our main focus has been connecting young people from different European backgrounds through science, art, and non-formal education, using these fields as tools for dialogue, creativity, and participation.
<br /><br />
Today, we are reactivating the informal group with a clearer focus, building on the knowledge, practices, and experience we gained through Vision Network Athens. As the organisation is gradually reducing its activities, we see the informal group as a natural continuation of our youth work, allowing us to stay active and engaged in a structure that fits our current situation. The members of the group are currently 17–20 years old.
