Most of our experience in youth work comes from our long-term involvement in Vision Network Athens, where we have participated in local workshops, discussion groups, youth exchanges, and training courses. Through these activities, we learned and practiced non-formal education methods, youth participation, and teamwork, with a particular focus on using science and art as tools for learning, expression, and connection between young people.
<br /><br />
At local level, we have supported the preparation and implementation of workshops and small-scale activities, helped with logistics, and gradually taken on more active roles as our experience grew. Working alongside more experienced youth workers helped us understand how youth activities are planned and delivered in a practical and inclusive way.
<br /><br />
As an informal group, we also gained experience through our participation as a partner in an Erasmus+ project, which helped us better understand international cooperation, communication with partners, and shared responsibilities within Erasmus+ projects.
<br /><br />
We now aim to continue and further develop our youth work at local level by connecting young people from different backgrounds through science, art, and non-formal education, using peer-to-peer learning approaches and further strengthening our capacity through Erasmus+ projects.
