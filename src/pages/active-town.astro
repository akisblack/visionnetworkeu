            <h3>About the project</h3>
            <p>
                The Active town project is an initiative aimed at revitalizing rural communities through youth engagement and sustainable development. Set in Ypati, Greece, this project focuses on empowering young people to explore alternative tourism, intercultural collaboration, and local development strategies. Participants will collaborate with local stakeholders to harness the town's cultural and natural assets, fostering community life and economic opportunities.
            </p>
            <p>
                By encouraging youth participation, the project seeks to promote rural areas as attractive places to live, work, and invest in. Through workshops, field activities, and community engagement, participants will develop innovative ideas to enhance the vitality of Ypati and similar rural towns.

            <h3>Details / Concept note</h3>
            <p>The “Active town” project aims to revitalize rural areas and make them lively
            by engaging youth and promoting alternative tourism. Many villages face
            problems like declining populations, fewer youth organizations, and limited
            events. Young people are becoming less active in their communities, while the
            area’s natural beauty and historical assets are underutilized.</p>
            
            <p>The project will:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Encourage youth to actively participate in community life.</li>
                <li>Foster intercultural collaboration.</li>
                <li>Teach skills for sustainable tourism and rural development.</li>
                <li>Highlight how to preserve and showcase local culture and environment.</li>
                <li>Promote the idea of rural areas as valuable places to live and invest in.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Activities include team-building workshops, cultural exchanges, brainstorming
            sessions, and developing tourism strategies for Ypati. Participants will interact
            with locals, explore the town’s assets, and create plans for future
            development.</p>

            <p>The project expects to boost tourism, enhance rural economies, and inspire
            young people to create change in their communities. It also demonstrates how
            European initiatives can address local challenges, promoting active citizenship
            and collaboration beyond borders.</p>

            <p>This project will take place in the town of Ypati, Fthiotis, Greece in August
            2026. There will be a total of 30 participants (18-25 y.o), 5+1 group leader /
            country. The working language will be English and costs for accommodation,
            meals, and a large part of travel fees are covered by the EU.</p>
